# CIBMTR IG LANDING PAGE
The CIBMTR IG Landing Page provides a central location for accessing CIBMTR HL7 FHIR implementation guides. 

## Technologies Used (with links)
1. [HL7 / FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/)
2. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/cheat-sheet/) - a high-performance static-site generator. Review the [Gatsby Cheat Sheet](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/cheat-sheet/).
4. [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - Gatsby sites may use ReactJS-style components and development patterns.
5. Markdown - Gatsby site content may be written in markdown. Review the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
6. [Graph QL](https://graphql.org/) - a powerful data querying language. Review how it is used in Gatsby [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/graphql-concepts/).

## Installation
> Before installing this application, you should have the follow installed in your development environment:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - current or LTS (_Should include npm_)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) - `npm install -g gatsby-cli`


To install the landing page application for the first time:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine  
`git clone https://github.com/nmdp-ig/cibmtr-ig-landing.git`
2. Change to the project directory  
`cd cibmtr-ig-landing`
3. Install all the project dependencies  
`npm install`

The site is now ready for development! A more detailed guide can be found [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/).

## Running Locally for Development
> Gatsby projects come with a live reloading development server. As you make and save changes to project files, those changes will be immediately reflected in what you see in your browser window. (_Changes to gatsby-config.js require a stop and rebuild._)

The development server can be started with:   
`gatsby develop`

Your site will be running at `https://localhost:8000`.

## Browse the Site's Datasource with GraphiQL
GraphQL is the magic behind many of Gatsby's optimizations and features. The data stored is queried and retrieved at build time to create pages, fill page content, transform images, and more. While developing, it is very useful to be able to query this data source. Gatsby provides a graphical user interface, called Graph iQL, into this data source that is accessible while running a local development server.

You can access this data source and browse its contents at:   
`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

Review the Gatsby [tutorial for Graph iQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/running-queries-with-graphiql/)


## Build for Production
To create a production build for this site:   
`gatsby build`

The resulting output can be found in the `/public` directory. The contents of this directory are the entire site and they can be deployed from this folder to any Apache-style webserver.

To see the production build on your local machine:   
`gatsby serve`

## Folder Structure

    /  
    |-- /.cache
    |-- /public
    |-- /src
        |-- /components
        |-- /data
        |-- /images

    |-- gatsby-browser.js

**`.cache`** - Internal cache for the Gatsby framework. Do not include in source control. Do not modify this folder.

**`public`** - After running a build, Gatsby outputs the final, ready-to-deploy website to this folder.

**`src`** - This is the source code of the site. Modifications to look of the website and its content are done here.

**`src/components`** - Gatsby sites may use React user interface components. Such components are found in this folder. For example, the site's header, layout, and SEO can be modified here.

**`src/data`** - The data folder has files that insert data into the site's graph data source. This information can be used at build time to programmatically build pages or content. For example, the list of implementation guides and the data that generates a card-style visualization for the items in that list are found in `guides.yml` in this folder.

**`src/images`** - A folder for all the images used on the site. These images will be processed and transformed as needed by the Gatsby build process.

**`src/pages`** - Code for each of the site's pages is found here. Pages may be React-style or Markdown-style. Supplementary pages (those found in the navigation bar on the site) should be written in Markdown and added to this folder.

**`src/styles`** - Custom CSS files are found in this folder. A file called `nmdp-styles.css` has been provided for this purpose.

**`src/templates`** - Templates may be employed in a Gatsby site to enhance development and streamline code. The supplementary pages template is found in this folder. Modifying it will modify every supplementary page in the site.

Review the Gatsby project structure [guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-project-structure/).

## Important Files
### Configuration
**`gatsby-browser.js`** - Add/remove CSS files to the project. The CSS files must be in `src/styles`.

**`gatsby-config.js`** - Modify site meta data, add/remove Gatsby plugins, modify Gatsby config.

**`gatsby-node.js`** - Has code for programmatically creating supplementary pages. You should not need to modify this file.

**`pacakage.json`** - Add/remove dependencies to the project, modify some site meta data.

### Styling
**`styles/nmdp-styles.css`** - Branding related styles, styles for the guide link cards, styles for the header, styles for the navbar, fonts.

**`src/components/layout.css`** - Modify page styling (if the page uses the layout).

### UI Components
**`src/components/header.js`** - Code for the header of the site.

**`src/components/layout.js`** - Code that describes the structure of pages in the site. Markdown is injected into this code to make the various pages.

**`src/components/guide-link.js`** - A component used to represent each implementation guide link.

### SEO
**`src/components/seo.js`** - Code for manipulating the search engine optimization for the site.

## Development How-To
> IDE Recommendation: Visual Studio Code is available on all platforms, is light-weight, will not pollute your source code with configuration files, and has many one-click install plugins that make developing a Javascript-based site easy.

### How To: Add/Remove/Modify an IG Link
Implementation Guide Links are programatically created by Gatsby. You input data into the data store, you query for that same data and pass it into the page that needs it, and then refer to it in the HTML where you want it.

**`DATA INPUT`** `src/data/guides.yml` - This file is a list of objects. It defines the schema for the object and lists all the values. Much like a database table or JSON, properties are shared by all objects; values are object-specific. This data is put into the Gatsby data store.

**`DATA QUERY`** `src/pages/index.js:33` - This is your call to "the backend". It is a GraphQL query on the index page, where the guide links display. Whatever data you want to display, ask for it here.

**`DATA DISPLAY`** `src/components/guide-link.js` - This is where you can change the HTML. The data from your query is passed into this component. You can refer to the data with the pattern `{ guide.property_name }` in the HTML.

If you make changes in one of these files, verify in the other two files that you have what you need before saving or building. 

### How To: Add/Remove/Modify a supplementary web page
This site can have any number of extra, supplementary pages. These pages, once created, can be linked to in the navigation bar at the top of each page.

**`CONTENT`** `src/pages/page_name.md` - Pages are added as Markdown files in the pages sub-directory. Each page, like a blog post in other frameworks, has a `frontmatter` section at the top of the page that looks like this:

    ---
    title: "About Us"
    ---

Think of this like a custom data object for the page. Anything you add here as a key/value pair can be referenced on the page it is found on.

Below the frontmatter section is the content section. Use markdown syntax to create or modify the content of the page.

**`TEMPLATED CONTENT`** `src/templates/supplementary-page.js` - This is the HTML template that encapsulates the supplementary page content. It uses the layout component to ensure that the navbar and styling are consistent across all the pages. Modifying the HTML here will change every supplementary page.

**`DATA QUERY`** `src/templates/supplementary-page.js:15` - Here again we have a call to "the backend". This query gets the HTML compiled from the markdown and injects it into the template. It also asks for the frontmatter from the page and passes it in as well. If you add more or less frontmatter in the markdown, ask for it here.

**`NAV BAR LINKS`** `gatsby-config.js:7` - Nav bar links need to be referenced in the config file so that routes can be produced at build time. If you add or remove a supplementary page from the nav bar, modify this list of menu links as well.

### How To: Modify the styling of the site
There are two style sheets in this project:

- `src/components/layout.css` - If you want to change the look and feel of the site overall, modify this file. Each page employs the layout component so changes made to this file will have a global effect.

- `src/styles/nmdp-styles.css` - This is where most of the branding-related CSS lives. 

> Additional style sheets may be added or removed by modifying the imports in `gatsby-browser.js`. If running `gatsby develop` you may need to restart the dev server for these changes to apply.

### How To: Change what links display in the nav bar
Open `gatsby-config.js` and modify the array of `menuLinks` on line 7. 

### How To: Add an image to the site
> You are able to add images to pages with standard React syntax; however, Gatsby comes with powerful image transformation functionality that can be employed for auto-magical image optimization.

1. Add the image to the `src/images` folder. Gatsby will scan this folder early in the build process and input image meta data into the GraphQL data source.
2. Create a GraphQL query on the component page (_not markdown pages_) where you want the processed image to appear or pass it into a component from another page. 
3. Create an <Img> element on the page and reference the query data in it.

It is a little complex but there are many [good tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-image/) for this functionality.
